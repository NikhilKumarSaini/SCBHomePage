AI System to Detect Manipulated Bank Statements Using Image Forensics & Machine Learning


---

1️⃣ Problem Statement (Short & Clear)

Banks receive thousands of bank statements and financial documents during loan processing.
Many applicants edit PDFs/images using Photoshop/Canva to fake salary, account balance, or transactions.
Manual verification cannot detect subtle manipulations.

We need an AI-based system that automatically analyzes a bank statement and detects whether it has been edited or tampered using image forensics + ML.


---

2️⃣ Solution Overview (What our system will do)

Our solution is an end-to-end AI pipeline that:

✔ Converts PDFs to images

✔ Extracts text using OCR

✔ Applies Image Forensics techniques:

Error Level Analysis (ELA)

Noise pattern analysis

Compression difference

Metadata & timestamp check

Font & alignment consistency check


✔ ML Model

Trains a classifier to detect whether a document is genuine or manipulated.

✔ Final Output

Tampering Score (0–100)

Highlighted suspicious areas

Reasons (font mismatch, ELA anomaly, compression difference)

OCR text summary (optional)


This will act as a fraud detection layer for banks/fintech companies.

4️⃣ Detailed Architecture (Text Form)

Step-by-Step Pipeline

1. Document Ingestion

User uploads PDF or image.

PDF is converted to PNG/JPG.


2. Preprocessing

Resize + Normalize

Remove noise

Segment important regions (amounts, tables)


3. Image Forensics Engine

Includes 5 modules:

1. ELA (Error Level Analysis)
Highlights edited or recompressed areas.


2. Noise Analysis
Detects irregular noise in tampered areas.


3. JPEG Artifact Analysis
If only parts of document were re-saved, compression changes.


4. Metadata Extraction
Detect if PDF was edited in Photoshop/Canva.


5. Font Consistency Analysis
Amount/Name fields are checked for font-size differences.



4. OCR Engine

Extracts text using Tesseract or EasyOCR

Compares extracted text with typical bank patterns


5. ML Classification

A hybrid model:

CNN on ELA image

RandomForest/XGBoost on forensic features

Combined to predict “Real / Fake”


6. Report Generation

Fraud score

Highlighted tampered regions

PDF summary

Reasons for detection

5️⃣ What Work Will Be Done (Team Responsibilities)

👤 Member 1 – Forensics & ML (You)

Dataset creation (genuine + fake statements)

Implement PDF → image converter

Image Forensics (ELA, noise, compression)

Build ML model (baseline + improved)


👤 Member 2 – OCR + App + Visualization

OCR pipeline

Streamlit/React-based UI

Visualization of tampered zones

Deployment (optional)


🟦 Common Tasks

Documentation

Model training

Report generation

Open-source release

6️⃣ Data Sources (Clearly Stated)

We are NOT using real bank customer data.
Only safe, public, or synthetic data.

1. Synthetic Bank Statements

Build our own bank statement templates using Python or HTML

Generate 200–300 genuine statements

Create tampered versions by:

Changing amounts

Editing text

Copy-paste from other documents

Adding artificial compression



2. Public Sample Statements

Download masked/dummy statement PDFs from:

HDFC, ICICI, SBI sample formats

Global open sample PDFs


3. Open Data (Optional)

Use transaction datasets from Kaggle to generate realistic tables.

Dataset Size Goal

200 genuine

600 tampered variants

~800 total images

7️⃣ Tech Stack

ML + Forensics

Python

OpenCV

PIL

NumPy

scikit-learn

PyTorch (for CNN)


OCR

Tesseract OCR

EasyOCR


Metadata

PyPDF2

exiftool


Web App

Streamlit or FastAPI

Optional: React frontend


Deployment

8️⃣ Final Deliverables

✔ AI Model (real vs fake detection)

✔ Forensics module (ELA, metadata, font check)

✔ OCR module

✔ Demo web app

✔ Architecture diagram

9️⃣ Summary

“We are building an AI system that uses image forensics and machine learning to automatically detect manipulated or fake bank statements, using synthetic data, OCR, ELA, metadata analysis and a classification model. The solution will be provided as a working demo + open-source toolkit.
