AI System to Detect Manipulated Bank Statements Using Image Forensics & Machine Learning

1️⃣ Problem Statement (Short & Clear)
Banks and financial institutions receive a very large number of bank statements and financial documents during loan processing, credit assessment, and KYC verification.
In many cases, applicants intentionally manipulate these documents using tools such as Photoshop, Canva, or simple PDF editors to alter critical details like salary amount, account balance, or transaction history. These manipulations are often subtle and visually convincing.
Manual verification is:


Time-consuming


Error-prone


Unable to detect pixel-level or compression-based tampering


There is a strong need for an automated, intelligent system that can analyze bank statements and reliably detect whether a document has been digitally altered.

2️⃣ Solution Overview (What our system will do)
Our solution is an end-to-end AI-powered document forensics system that automatically analyzes uploaded bank statements and identifies signs of manipulation.
The system performs the following tasks:
✔ Converts uploaded PDF bank statements into images for analysis
✔ Applies multiple image forensics techniques to detect tampering
✔ Extracts document metadata and structural patterns
✔ Uses a Machine Learning model as a supporting decision layer
✔ Produces a final tampering risk score (0–100) with clear classification
✔ Generates a detailed forensic report that can be downloaded
The solution acts as a fraud detection layer that banks or fintech platforms can integrate into their document verification workflows.

4️⃣ Detailed Architecture (Text Form)
Step-by-Step Pipeline

1. Document Ingestion


The user uploads a bank statement in PDF or image format.


Each uploaded document is stored securely with a unique identifier.


PDFs are converted into images so that visual forensics techniques can be applied.



2. Preprocessing


Images are resized and normalized.


Noise is reduced to avoid false positives.


The document is prepared for forensic feature extraction.



3. Image Forensics Engine
This is the core part of the system and includes multiple independent forensic modules:

1️⃣ Error Level Analysis (ELA)
ELA detects differences in compression levels across the document.
If certain regions have been edited and recompressed separately, they appear prominently in ELA images.

2️⃣ Noise Pattern Analysis
Natural documents have consistent noise patterns.
Edited regions often show irregular noise due to copy-paste or re-rendering operations.

3️⃣ Compression Artifact Analysis
If only specific parts of the document are modified and saved again, compression artifacts become inconsistent across regions.

4️⃣ Metadata Extraction
PDF metadata is analyzed to identify:


Editing tools (Photoshop, Canva, etc.)


Creation and modification timestamps


Producer and author information


Unexpected metadata patterns often indicate document tampering.

5️⃣ Font & Layout Consistency Analysis
This module checks:


Font size mismatches


Alignment inconsistencies


Irregular spacing in critical fields like amounts and names


Such inconsistencies frequently occur when text is manually edited.

4. OCR Engine (Optional / Supporting)


OCR is used to extract text from the document.


Extracted values can be validated against expected bank statement patterns.


OCR also helps in highlighting suspicious textual regions.



5. ML Classification
A Machine Learning layer is added as a supporting signal, not the primary decision-maker.


Forensic features are passed to an ML model.


The model learns common manipulation patterns from synthetic data.


ML output helps strengthen confidence in borderline cases.


The final decision is dominated by forensics, with ML acting as an assistive layer.

6. Report Generation
For each document, the system generates:


Final tampering risk score (0–100)


Risk classification (Clean, Low, Moderate, High, etc.)


Individual forensic scores


Downloadable forensic evidence (images & analysis)


Structured JSON report

9️⃣ Summary

We are building an AI-based system that automatically detects manipulated bank statements using image forensics and machine learning. The system analyzes PDFs and images, applies multiple forensic techniques, computes a calibrated risk score, and generates clear, explainable results. This solution can act as a reliable fraud detection layer for banks and fintech platforms.

14️⃣ Challenges & Limitations
Challenges
Forensic calibration:
Techniques like ELA and compression are sensitive and may show mild signals even in genuine documents created using Word, scanners, or re-exported PDFs.
False positives:
Distinguishing between benign document complexity and actual manipulation required careful threshold tuning.
Synthetic data constraints:
Synthetic datasets do not fully capture advanced real-world fraud techniques, which can affect ML generalization.
ELA variability:
ELA results depend on image resolution and PDF-to-image conversion quality.
ML confidence stability:
ML predictions may remain conservative in borderline cases and require calibration with forensic scores.
Limitations
Optimized mainly for bank statements
Performance may vary on low-quality scans
OCR accuracy depends on document clarity
15️⃣ Next Steps & Improvements
Future Enhancements
Expand dataset with more diverse and realistic synthetic samples
Improve forensic score normalization across document types
Add deep-learning-based tampering localization
Strengthen ML models using ensemble or CNN-based approaches
Enhance OCR-based semantic validation of transactions
Expose the system as an API for real-world banking integration
