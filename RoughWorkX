Slide 2 – Problem Statement
Problem Statement

Banks process thousands of bank statements during loan and KYC verification.

Many applicants manipulate documents using tools like:

Photoshop

Canva

PDF editors

These manipulations include:

Changing balances

Editing salary amounts

Modifying transaction entries

Challenges with Manual Verification

Time-consuming

Human error

Cannot detect pixel-level or compression-based tampering

👉 Need: An automated AI-based system to detect manipulated bank statements reliably.

Slide 3 – Objective of the Project
Project Objective

Build an end-to-end AI system that:

Analyzes bank statements (PDF/Image)

Detects digital manipulation

Assigns a clear risk score

Generates a forensic report

Key Goals

Detect subtle tampering invisible to humans

Reduce manual verification effort

Provide explainable forensic evidence

Slide 4 – Solution Overview
Our Solution

An AI-powered document forensics pipeline that:

✔ Accepts PDF or image bank statements
✔ Converts PDFs to images
✔ Applies multiple image forensics techniques
✔ Uses ML as a supporting signal
✔ Produces a final risk score (0–100)
✔ Generates downloadable forensic reports

👉 Acts as a fraud detection layer for banks and fintech platforms.

Slide 5 – High-Level System Architecture
High-Level Flow

User uploads bank statement

PDF converted to images

Image forensics analysis

Feature aggregation & scoring

Machine Learning signal

Final risk decision & report

Pipeline:
Upload → Processing → Forensics → Scoring → ML → Report

Slide 6 – Detailed Pipeline (Step-by-Step)
Step 1: Document Ingestion

User uploads PDF or image

File stored with unique identifier

PDFs converted to images

Step 2: Preprocessing

Image normalization

Noise reduction

Preparation for forensic analysis

Slide 7 – Image Forensics Engine
Core Forensics Modules

1️⃣ Error Level Analysis (ELA)

Detects recompression differences

Highlights edited regions

2️⃣ Noise Pattern Analysis

Identifies irregular noise caused by edits

3️⃣ Compression Artifact Analysis

Detects partial recompression in documents

4️⃣ Font & Layout Consistency Check

Detects font-size and alignment mismatches

5️⃣ Metadata Analysis

Checks PDF author, producer, timestamps

Identifies editing tools like Photoshop/Canva

Slide 8 – Machine Learning Component
ML Role in the System

ML is used as a supporting signal, not the sole decision-maker

Trained on synthetic genuine and tampered documents

Learns patterns from forensic features

ML Output

Probability score indicating likelihood of manipulation

Combined with forensic score for final decision

Slide 9 – Scoring & Decision Logic
Final Decision Strategy

Forensics Score → Primary signal

ML Score → Secondary signal

Combined into a final risk score (0–100)

Risk Categories

Clean Document

Low Risk

Moderate Risk

High Risk

Very High Risk

Critical Risk

Slide 10 – Output & Reporting
System Output

Final Risk Score (0–100)
