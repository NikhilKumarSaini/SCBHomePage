1. Overall, the team worked really well together this week. With all eight of us involved, our discussions were productive, and we managed to create the wireframes and get a good start on the front-end. Everyone contributed ideas, and it was great to see everyone actively engaged from day one.
2. Since we were just getting started, there were a few onboarding hiccups  some of us weren’t fully clear on the tools at first, which slowed things down a bit. Also, some tasks, like wireframes and setting up the repo, axure devops took longer than we expected. We also focused on the front end but still we have to work on it.

3. we can make task allocation clearer so everyone knows exactly what they’re responsible for. We should also do a better job documenting our work so anyone new joining the project can get up to speed quickly. And it’s probably a good idea to start backend planning early on so we can progress on both sides in parallel. Regular quick check-ins or standups can also help us spot and fix blockers sooner.
